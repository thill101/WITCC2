While this approach has advantages, it creates friction with the operations folks tasked with getting changes into production. Last month, Rocket Software&apos;s Aldon division started rolling out its new ALM Hub functionality to help the two sides collaborate more effectively while still respecting separation-of-duty requirements.</value>

                  type="Simple">Twenty years ago, IBM introduced OpenEdition MVS, their first foray into &quot;opening&quot; the mainframe to a new community of developers. This release included the Shell and Utilities priced feature. Production cost varied with the size of the mainframe. If you consider that only a handful of people might actually use this code when originally shipped, the &quot;cost per seat&quot; was astronomical compared to what was free or inexpensive on desktop systems. This was corrected when IBM began shipping this feature as part of the base of the new OS/390 operating system. This dramatically reduced the cost and skills needed for new workload development on the mainframe for customers and vendors. But without the revenue associated with the previously priced feature, IBM didn&apos;t keep up with the open source community and quickly, these tools fell behind. This was an unintended consequence....</value>
